Duuuude, just finished Final Destination: Bloodlines and wow, I need a breather. Seriously, how do they keep coming up with these wild death scenes? Like, I'm all for creative kills but this one had me questioning what kinda fever dream the writers had. You know what I mean? The scenes just kept escalating and I was like, “how do they top this next?” Yet somehow, they DID.

It's so weird, when you're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 and you catch yourself predicting who's gonna bite it next. Poor Timmy with his skateboard, though. I kinda low-key called it but it was still nuts. Made me wanna chuck my own skateboard out the window just in case it goes rogue, haha. I think they purposely amp up the anticipation—it’s like, torture but you can’t look away.

> It's kinda messed up, but I ended up feeling bad for Death, having to work so hard n all. Like, chill bro, take a break. Is that weird? LOL

Oh! And you won't believe it, but halfway through I realized I should've 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   instead of 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 it. Buffering killed the vibe at this tense moment and I almost threw my laptop out of my window but, ya know, technology's necessary evil and stuff. Pray for better Wi-Fi or something.

Anyway, the whole gym scene? Pure madness. I’m never stepping on a treadmill again. Everything’s a weapon in this series! And honestly, after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   I'm hesitant to step out of the house tomorrow. Might just cocoon myself in pillows, haha. I dunno why I thought 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this was a chill idea.

What’s wrong with me dropping a random line of Python code here, lmao? Brain’s all over. Anyway, I’m signing out. My brain's officially on overload. Time to dream some happy non-lethal dreams, hopefully. Catch ya later!
